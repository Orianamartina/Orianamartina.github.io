## My process
For this project, i first organized my Html code, normally i go from top to bottom, and write css simultaneously, but for this one i found it easier to write first Html and then css.
Then i established the color and font variables.
After that it was all trial and error.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

As a beginner, i was able to use all the information that i knew i had in my head but i wasn't sure how to use or when to use it.
I think i will revisit this project once again later, maybe do it again, to see if i can achieve it in a easier way, or more optimal way, as i still have a lot to practice and learn.

I had trouble pathing the images, so i moved them all to the main folder, i will work on that on my next project!! i know it is a mess, sorry :P

If anyone help me with aligning the icons where the rice and time are, i will really appreciate it!!!
i tried a lot of things but i couldn't get it to work :C
